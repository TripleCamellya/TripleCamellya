I'm SeeleZaych, an undergraduate from SJTU, and I will continue to pursue a master's degree in IST lab of SJTU.


Recently, I have been mainly working on machine learning in the fields of Computer Vision (CV) and Time Series (TS), and I am currently researching Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Web Serice and Database are also very appealing to me.


I hope to make my own contributions to the community!
